`ToDoBEM`
============


## Aim

This programm is a direct pedagogic implementation of the Boundary Element Method (BEM) with constant element for acoustic problem in matlab language. The code has been designed with [EPD](http://www.utc.fr/~eperreyd/) as an illustration of his course for [SUPMECA](https://www.supmeca.fr/) engineer students

> Méthode des éléments de frontière pour l'acoustique

> available [here](http://vibroacoustique.fr/cours/M06_C02/co/VAC_M06_C02_web.html)

which is a part of a large structural acoustic [open course](http://vibroacoustique.fr/) (in french), proposed by and UNIT (Université Numérique Ingénierie et Technologie) and french acoustical society SFA. 

The code is opimized for clarity instead of performance :-)

Basic example like pulsating sphere, oscillation sphere or scattering problem are given.

## Basic Usage

```
blablabla
blablabla
```

## Installation
Just download or clone the project. Eventually unzip the file and add the folder to matlab path.
